The chocolate chip cookie cones at Mike's Ice Cream are an interesting concept, but the review suggests that they may not be for everyone. While the idea of a cookie cone is exciting and unique, the reviewer found the cone to be a bit hard to bite and didn't particularly enjoy the flavor. They expressed that while they wouldn't order the cookie cone again, they appreciated the experience of trying it. However, they were very pleased with the coconut ice cream itself and would definitely return for more of that flavor. Overall, the cookie cone is worth a try for the novelty, but it may not meet everyone's taste preferences.
