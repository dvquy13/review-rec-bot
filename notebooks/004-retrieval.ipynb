Now how is that possible when you have prepaid the bill on full and there are no other places to stay on a holiday weekend at the last minute? Chase's rules are that the customer is never worthy of a reimbursement even if the Airbnb is unclean, has no WiFi and does not offer the amenities as marketed.

Theirs was pretty good and I loved the crunchy texture of coconut flakes throughout the ice cream. I ordered mine in the cookie cone. I can imagine making a cookie cone would be complicated, you have to make it hard enough to hold ice cream and tight enough to not drip. The cookie cone was a little hard to bite and I did not particularly care for the flavor. I wouldn't not get it again, but it was fun to give it a try!
