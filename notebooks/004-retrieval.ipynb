      "I ended up going with a two scoops in a waffle cone, one scoop of pistachio and one chocolate overload. First of all the portions are huge!! I should have stuck with one scoop but I couldn't pick just one flavor of course. The pistachio was delicious, prefect flavor and super creamy with little bits of pistachios. The chocolate overload was good, I will probably do the cake batter next time in place of the chocolate, but I'm for sure sticking the pistachio. Their waffle cones were also delicious and fresh.\n",

      "\n",
      "Context:\n",
      "Twin peaks has been open for a couple of months and I had heard good things about the food and the scenery and decided to check it out. I was told by some of my friends that it was substantially better than Hooters in both regards as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were seated faster than I expected and initially thought it was strange that we were sitting at a very long table along with others. The table was separated by a piece of wood with an ax in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Toni was the best. I'll be back for lunch every time I'm in the area! This is my new favorite restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never even knew this place existed or had heard of it before. Not bad for an average sports bar with sports bar food. The ladies look very nice in their \"uniforms\" which are very short shorts with their cheeks showing and crop tops with the \"peaks\" showing hence the name twin peaks! \n",
      "        We had mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and sandwiches with fries. Nothing to write home about but it was good. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a big sports bar guy and a sports bar food guy and don't expect a sports bar to be 5 star dining. Let me answer a question that people ask me when I said I ate there. \"Is it okay to bring your wife and kids there to watch a game?\" The servers do wear low cut shirts and shorts, but nothing that was any different than other themed sports bars. When I was there, there were groups of women together and also couples there. \n",
      "\n",
      "You came here for the twin peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, the food is on par with other sports bars, which means it's mediocre. So why four stars instead of the 2-3 stars I consistently give to sports bars with mediocre food (which is all of them)? Because twin peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that Twin Peaks has a unique atmosphere that sets it apart from other sports bars. However, if you're looking for sports bars in Indianapolis that offer a better dining experience, you might want to consider places that focus more on upscale or gourmet options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some possibilities could be sports bars that serve high-end pub fare, have a more extensive menu with creative dishes, or offer a more refined atmosphere. You might also want to look for places that have received positive reviews for their food quality and presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the best way to find a sports bar that meets your expectations is to do some research and read reviews from other diners. You can check out online review sites, ask for recommendations from friends or colleagues, or try out a few different places to see which one you enjoy the most.\n",

We were immediately seated, the decor, a bit outdated, quite possibly the same decor from the prior owners, that is not a fact though, as I\\'m not certain. I was curious to know what the lure of his place was and I quickly came to learn what \"Twin peak\" was all about just by looking around. I would almost say that it is a modern day Hooters but I probably shouldn\\'t count them out yet because they are still up and kicking he-he. I could not help but notice that the majority of the patrons were men, mainly older and middle aged. The uniforms were very skimpy shorts and very revealing tops. The women are beautiful, I can\\'t help but to believe that they are very careful and particular during the interviewing process. Our server was delightful. She Was able to answer questions regarding the menu, even stood around and made small talk, very nice. On to the food, and I already checked out the menu prior to our arrival and I knew because I was keeping ut keto that I was going to try the smoke chicken wings out, my love wanted fish and chips, but the chips to be replaced with onion rings,  my side was green beans but I didn\\'t realize that it had pork in it which I do not eat so I passed that on to my honey and he said that it was not a stitch of seasoning on it. My wing portion was as expected, however what we were not expecting was for my honey to only receive one piece of fish. We asked if that was the regular portion size and was told yes. This lunch was pretty expensive for what was received, we had no business stopping in the first place but we could not avoid it because of the type of traffic they receive, the curiosity piqued our interest.
