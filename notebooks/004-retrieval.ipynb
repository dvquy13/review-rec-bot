It started with check-in and seating. When we arrived, the two hosts, clearly flustered and whom I felt badly for if I'm being honest as they were overwhelmed, were arguing with each other over a table that had been somehow mis-seated. They audibly (and in front of other guests) tried to work this issue out but meanwhile let other guests linger in the very small waiting area in the front without explanation. \n",

      "\n",
      "Once seated (and starving), we received a brief apology from our server and he noted that this \"happens around the 8pm reservation time sometimes,\" so it seems like this seating delay is a common problem Green Pheasant is aware of. We immediately ordered some dishes because we were starving. Since the first two were raw foods, they were delivered to us fairly quickly. The rest took FOREVER. We were told the kitchen was very backed up and they'd come out as they were ready. To say this was frustrating after our wait to be seated was an understatement. \n",

He never did a table touch to ask about or experience in general, or to apologize for the wait for the table or food delays.

      "['The parking lot to this establishment is often filled to the brim! We decided to swing by during lunch hour as there were not as many cars in the lot. We were immediately seated, the decor, a bit outdated, quite possibly the same decor from the prior owners, that is not a fact though, as I\\'m not certain. I was curious to know what the lure of his place was and I quickly came to learn what \"Twin peak\" was all about just by looking around. I would almost say that it is a modern day Hooters but I probably shouldn\\'t count them out yet because they are still up and kicking he-he. I could not help but notice that the majority of the patrons were men, mainly older and middle aged. The uniforms were very skimpy shorts and very revealing tops. The women are beautiful, I can\\'t help but to believe that they are very careful and particular during the interviewing process. Our server was delightful. She Was able to answer questions regarding the menu, even stood around and made small talk, very nice. On to the food, and I already checked out the menu prior to our arrival and I knew because I was keeping ut keto that I was going to try the smoke chicken wings out, my love wanted fish and chips, but the chips to be replaced with onion rings,  my side was green beans but I didn\\'t realize that it had pork in it which I do not eat so I passed that on to my honey and he said that it was not a stitch of seasoning on it. My wing portion was as expected, however what we were not expecting was for my honey to only receive one piece of fish. We asked if that was the regular portion size and was told yes. This lunch was pretty expensive for what was received, we had no business stopping in the first place but we could not avoid it because of the type of traffic they receive, the curiosity piqued our interest. YOU DON\\'T DO HERE FOR FOOD that\\'s for sure. With that being said we will not be returning.']\n",
