When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation. Honestly I dont want to give this place any sort of good review but Ill give them 1 star ... Only because all they are good for is a sloppy slice of pizza to get you from the bar to your home on a drunken Friday night.</td>\n",

This is a very classic white tablecloth, tuxedoed waiter type of restaurants, but amazingly it is not stuffy or pretentious.\\n\\nOnce you arrive at your table, the waiter appears with a loaf of freshly-baked bread and lightly-salted butter as he takes your drink order.\\n\\nHaving been at Mr. B's many times in the past I went straight for my favorite things on the menu. To start I had Mr. B's Crabcake, which was a pan-sauteed jumbo lump crabcake served with their classic ravigote sauce. The crabcake was mostly big chunks of lump crabmeat with very little breading or filler. Following that I had their incredible seafood gumbo which was a classic New Orleans gumbo with Gulf shrimp, crabmeat, oysters, and okra served in a dark roux sauce.\\n\\nAnd now for my entree (pardon me while I wipe the drool off my mouth).... I ordered the legendary Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp which is their signature dish. Head-on Gulf shrimp barbequed New Orleans style, served in the shells with Worcestershire-spiked peppery butter sauce and French bread for dipping. The recipe for this amazing dish can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_shrimp.php\\n\\nTo finish this amazing meal, my lovely friend and I split an order of the Brennan family's Creole Bread Pudding. The recipe is rich in eggs, cream and butter, served warm with Irish whiskey sauce. Oh, and THAT recipe can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_breadpudding.php.\\n\\nSeriously, one of the best meals on the planet!</td>\n",

       "16089  Not sure where to start with this one so I guess Ill just take you on a walk thru of my entire experience. When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation. Honestly I dont want to give this place any sort of good review but Ill give them 1 star ... Only because all they are good for is a sloppy slice of pizza to get you from the bar to your home on a drunken Friday night.\n",

Just so many great places to eat and this place was bomb with fantastic service by Justin. Had some oyster dish that was just superb and want more. I don't even like blue cheese but it works in this dish. Had the crawfish beignets. Great. Bacon wrapped dates very nice. Ordered gnocci and loved it. Great flavor and mix. She had some pasta dish. It was all so good I forgot to take photos before eating things. The beignets are light fluffy and disappointing there aren't more :) great ambiance. Will be back.\n",

This is a very classic white tablecloth, tuxedoed waiter type of restaurants, but amazingly it is not stuffy or pretentious.\\n\\nOnce you arrive at your table, the waiter appears with a loaf of freshly-baked bread and lightly-salted butter as he takes your drink order.\\n\\nHaving been at Mr. B's many times in the past I went straight for my favorite things on the menu. To start I had Mr. B's Crabcake, which was a pan-sauteed jumbo lump crabcake served with their classic ravigote sauce. The crabcake was mostly big chunks of lump crabmeat with very little breading or filler. Following that I had their incredible seafood gumbo which was a classic New Orleans gumbo with Gulf shrimp, crabmeat, oysters, and okra served in a dark roux sauce.\\n\\nAnd now for my entree (pardon me while I wipe the drool off my mouth).... I ordered the legendary Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp which is their signature dish. Head-on Gulf shrimp barbequed New Orleans style, served in the shells with Worcestershire-spiked peppery butter sauce and French bread for dipping. The recipe for this amazing dish can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_shrimp.php\\n\\nTo finish this amazing meal, my lovely friend and I split an order of the Brennan family's Creole Bread Pudding.

Almost forgot Jackson's.  It was a recommendation from the Hutton Hotels' concierge.  On a drizzly Nashville morning, love & I just wanted a simple sit down brunch place to enjoy some eggs n things.  Mr. Concierge was pretty unwavering about this place Jackson's, a couple of miles away, in a cute little part of town.  We decided to give it a go.\\n\\nWhat an annoying place.\\n\\nCollege kids, post binging from the night before slamming mimosas by the bottle.  \\n\\nOf course there was a wait.\\n\\nHowever, we needed some quick as the blood sugar was crashing, and I pushed my way by through the little still hungover college kiddos and scanned the place for either a table I can snag without drawing attention from the young hostess who was huffing and puffing and dramatically trying to play circus keeper...emphasis on the dramatic.\\n\\nI saw 2 seats at the bar.  Beelined for it - mister was out parking the car.\\n\\nCounter was dirty, the poor girl was tending to what seemed like the entire restaurant by herself hence the rotten service and trying to spend as little time in there as possible, I ordered for both and hoped for the best.\\n\\nFood was below average, service was below average - not worth even mentioning...but hey, if you are still in college, or still behaving like you are in college, looking for a post party hangover brunch the next day, it's the place to be.\n",

I've been here twice, and enjoyed both experiences.  The atmosphere is very cool:  brick walls and contemporary artwork of skateboards as canvasses for original paintings.  I've tried three sandwiches:  the bird and pig, the portabella, and the Italian.  the Bird and Pig was delicious but dry, and required hot sauce (their homemade hot sauce is very tasty).  the Portabella was very generous in size, and had a nice mild flavor, but was still better with hot sauce.  The Italian was ok, but small and was also better with some hot sauce.   The chips and salsa were good and bad, since the salsa was home made, but the chips were from Sam's (why Bricks, why???).\\nThe beer selection is great.  The bartender was fun to talk to, but our waitress was a little avoidant.   Bottom line, good food, good atmosphere, great beer selection, good prices, decent service, but order the hot sauce because your sandwiches are a bit dry and bland for my tastes.  I'll definitely be back and have been spreading the word.  Keep it up Bricks!\n",

I think over all it sounded better than it was. I did like the fact that it's all about the food but the items I ordered fell a little short. I also read that the bloody Mary's were great so I ordered one. It was not great, in fact it was just mediocre, so I ordered a cold corona after that. The oysters were great but as long as they're fresh, they're going to be great. We had a san ysidro  shrimp cocktail. Sauce came on the side - it was basically a salad of mixed greens with avocado and poached shrimp. I ordered a lobster roll since it was on the feature board and I had read that it was really good. It was flavorless and not at all what I expected. The lobster rolls at Hungry Cat are bomb! This one was not good. The clam chowder is average, nothing special. The service was ok but everyone is nice. I like this place but food was nothing special.\n",

So.. we ordered the veggie plate to pick at. It was good, but we really weren't looking to eat so it was a bit annoying to have to pay for food when we didn't want to. Wine was good! Service was also very good.\\n\\nI will have to come back for a real meal and give it a try! I've heard good things.\n",

My wife and I treated my parents to dinner there on a Tuesday night (3-17), and the food, service and ambience were again wonderful. I finally ordered something other than the BBQ shrimp, and was rewarded with a tasty rendition of wood grilled redfish. My father had the BBQ shrimp, a first for him, and LOVED it. They provided a dish of vegetables with angel hair pasta for my vegan wife that was perfectly prepared and which she found to be excellent. My mother adored the scallops, one of her favorite dishes when done correctly. The service was wonderful without being obtrusive. Mr. B's will always be on my list every time I go to New Orleans.\n",

No ambiance, which for a coffee house is rare---- it tries to be hipster but the result is just a cold, unfriendly place. Even sitting outside is not a better alternative unless you want to face (and smell) a carwash. Staff is rude. My suggestion is to go to the French Press on State street instead, or better yet, Peet's. Even though both French Press locations serve the same coffee (or so I was told), somehow it is prepared better and presented better at the State Street location. I would suggest that this location on Anacapa is a must-miss.\n",

You know, the ones that pamper you, give you that superior service that makes you feel like royalty. Mr. B's Bistro is one of those special places.\\nThe food, the decor, the service. Everything is top-notch. So glad we made a reservation and got dressed up for our last special night in New Orleans.\n",

Booths are run down, not nice.  Brought my own salad dressing, since I don't care for theirs... \\n\\nThey make some delicious pinwheels, loaded with mozzarella cheese.  Their \"Farmhouse\" pizza is very tasty, but EXTREMELY (exceptionally) greasy, if you order pepperoni.\\n\\nSurprisingly good GF pizza crust.  Strange way of cutting the pizza in diamond pattern, it's hard to pull apart.  You can request traditional pie cut, but they will refuse to make a standard square pattern.  Kinda weird, but okay.\\n\\nNote to self:  next time ask them to hold the potato sticks from their salad, which is also kinda weird.\\n\\nOver-all, their weirdness can be worked with... Request a few adjustments and bring your own salad dressing.  \\n\\nThey are better than any of the primary/national pizza chains, and less expensive than Gondola House, and their food quality and cleanliness  earns them 4 stars.\n",

From day one, George has established the best entertainment venue in the city. A famed food critic a while ago validly questioned the direction of the kitchen. Well, as spoiled of a Philly brat that I am, I do promise you that the kitchen has arrived! Food is excellent! And then the beignets - CafÃ© du Monde has nothing on Tails' - they literally melt in your mouth. \\nYet, the best aspect of the joint is people! From the friendly faces of the guys and gals at the door (shout out for Nassir and Andre) to friendly, beautiful, and impeccably professional waitresses (shout out to Melissa), to friendly and refined gentlemen behind the bar (shout out to Matt and Adam, to the most \"user-friendly\" and cool management team (shout out to Rob and George), these folks make you feel both important and at home!\\nFrom the entertainment side of things, just in the past week, they had Deb Callahan, and Roger Girke - back to back! If you're a blues fan, how much better can it get..? It's Stone Cold blues there on the bandstand almost every night! \\nI try to average a night per week. You'd be foolish not to follow my suit. Enjoy!\\nDISCLOSURE: I officially state that I have no financial connections to the establishment and I'm not a surrogate endorser. I'm only partial to the place because it is that good on merit, and the folks there have become my friends because they're great folks!\n",

The food is always delicious, plentiful, fresh and authentic. For my birthday party this year I  decided to have dinner catered by them. The food was fabulous! We ordered the Chicken Shahi Korma, Beef Vindaloo amd many other delicious dishes. The Tandoori  Chicken and the Samosas were a big hit, just like the rest of the meal. Dessert was heavenly - rice pudding, and Gulab Jamun.  My guests were blown away and I will  definitely do this again . It was a pleasure working with Mr. RAJ, the owner/chef. Thank  you Mr. Raj.\\nIf I could give them more than 5 stars, I would.\n",

Have some delicious gelato at the Gelato shop . Many different food venues but bring a big fat pay check because it's not cheap . However if you are like me you go for a appetizer or get. Gelato cone after having lunch else wear. Bring your good camera beautiful views take ride in the gondola . Beautiful flowers everywhere .\n",
